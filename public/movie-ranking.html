<h1>The best animes According to Jayson</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>This is one of the best anime in my opinion. Love how Asta shows his perseverance even he has no magic at first</p>
<h3>Demon slayer</h3>
<p>I love the charactes Nezuko and Tanjiro. The animation are also awesome</p>
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>I have to join the bandwagon eventhough i just recently started watching it. Starting to like Monkey the Luffy.</p>
